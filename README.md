PROJECT TITLE: "Programming Exercise: Batch Grayscale and Image Inversion"

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use of Images and work with them (Pixels), exactly:
                    task 1 - convert image to a gray scale;
                    task 2 - invert image / create photographic negatives;
                    task 3 - save both versions of some images with new names:
                    "gray-example.png" for gray scaled image and
                    "inverted-example.png" for inverted / photographic negative image.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use BlueJ Environment to open project named "package.bluej". 
                           Find inside of this project 3 class: GrayScaleConvertor (class
                           that converts images into gray scale), BatchInversions (class
                           that inverts images / create photographic negatives) and
                           ImageSaver (combines those 2 classes) - compile, create object 
                           of type ImageSaver and start one of the following functions: 
                           "doSaveGray" for task 1; 
                           "doSaveInverted" for task 2;
